# Anomaly Detection Classification Algorithms
This repository contains files of the anomaly detection model for the production environment.
Anomaly Detection is a hot topic in recent years, where the goal is to identify abnormal data that are deviant from the general data distribution. Anomaly detection has been proven as an important area in diverge range of domains, such as credit card fraud analytics in the bank, malignant tumour detection, network intrusion detection, and mechanical unit defect detection etc.

# Goal 
The goal is to share anomaly detection ideas in production environment. Productuion enviromnt can be any type of manufacturing industry where speacific type of materials are produced.
# Anomaly detection with one-class svm
