# Anomaly Detection Classification Algorithms
This repository contains files of the anomaly detection model for the production environment.
Anomaly Detection is a hot topic in recent years, where the goal is to identify abnormal data that are deviant from the general data distribution. Anomaly detection has been proven as an important area in diverge range of domains, such as credit card fraud analytics in the bank, malignant tumour detection, network intrusion detection, and mechanical unit defect detection etc. I am going to follow classification algorithmns e.g random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, one- class support vector machine.

# Goal 
The goal is to share anomaly detection ideas in the production environment. Production environment can be any manufacturing industry where specific types of materials are produced.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this tutorial is from [Stream Machine Learning (Streaml) Open Challenge 2017-2018](https://project-hobbit.eu/open-challenges/streaml-open-challenge_details/). For details go the provided source.
